# Reinforcement Learning

I created this repository with the intention to learn about RL in an organized manner.
I initially planned to improve [anubis-checkers](https://github.com/universecoder/anubis-checkers)
by using the technique of self-play(like that of Arthur Samuel and AlphaGo/AlphaGo Zero), but now I am exploring it in detail.  

##### Structure
The structure of the repository is simple: there is one directory per RL framework(eg. one for ViZDoom and one for OpenAI).  
Each of these framework directories contain several bots that can play games. The comments indicate the tutorial followed to build the bot
(unless of course the idea/code is original).
